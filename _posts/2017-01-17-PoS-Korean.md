title: Korean Part-of-speech System
---

I always get confused when explaining Korean grammar concepts in English terms. I thought I'd organize them here and refer to it whenever I get confused again.

The part-of-speech system of Korean is drastically different to that of English. Think of "adjectives" in English. 

> The girl is **pretty**.

In English, adjectives behave like a noun. Try replacing "pretty" with "a person", and it still works.

> The girl is **a person**.

In some cases, the distinction between nouns and adjectives are blurry:

> That girl is **ten out of ten**.

Is "ten out of ten" a noun or an adjective? "ten" can't possibly be an adjective, right? Well, consider this:

> I saw a **ten-out-of-ten** girl today.

In English, modifying a noun is what only adjectives can do.

> The **pretty** girl is eating.

Koreans call English adjectives "형용사". "형용하다" means "to describe", so "형용사" literally means "describing words".

Then, in Korean grammar, the same word 형용사 is used to indicate what is commonly called "descriptive verbs". 

> 하늘이 **파랗다**. (1)

"파랗다" is a "descriptive verb", or what I like to call it, an adjective. Adjectives in Korean behave differently in Korean. It behaves like a verb. I'll try replacing "파랗다"(adj) with "무너지다"(verb), and you can see that it still works.

> 하늘이 **무너지다**.

Can Korean adjectives modify a noun then? Yes it can. But in order to do that, it must change its form to a noun modifier(관형어) by attaching "-ㄴ" to its stem.

> **파란** 하늘을 보다. (2)

What you should note about this is that 파랗다 didn't change its part-of-speech. It's still an adjective. What changed is the "sentence component". In sentence (1), the sentence component of 파랗다 is the predicate. In sentence (2), the sentence component of 파란 is the noun modifier. The part-of-speech in both of the sentences is the adjective. The verb ending (-다, -ㄴ) only changes the sentence component, never the part-of-speech. If the part-of-speech changes due to something that was attached to a stem, it's called a suffix(접사), not a verb ending(어미). Suffixes make new words. Verb endings make conjugations.

There is another part-of-speech that never changes its form, but acts as a noun modifier in a sentence. It's called an attributive(관형사).

> **새** 신발을 사다.

Verb endings never get attached to 새. Therefore, 새 never changes its form. In general, attributives are always noun modifiers.

Note that PoS terms are suffixed -사, and sentence components are suffixed -어.

Nouns and noun-likes can be every sentence component, with the corresponding case markers. Also note that every case marker is optional, dropping them normally doesn't change any significant meaning.

> 그저께에 길을 가다가 이상한 사람을 보았다. (O) <br>
> 그저께 길 가다가 이상한 사람 보았다. (O)

Verbs and adjectives can act as every part-of-speech, by taking the right verb endings. Verb endings shouldn't be dropped, dropping them normally leads the sentence grammatically incorrect.

> \*그저께 길 가 이상하 사람 보. (X)
