title: Middle Korean Honorifics

Hi, I'm going to talk about Middle Korean, specifically about the honorific system of Middle Korean in this post. But before anything else: what is Middle Korean?

### History of the Korean Language (and Korea)

Korean has existed since, well, forever. Precisely, we don't know for sure how long the language has existed, or where it came from. That's because Korean is a [language isolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate). In other words, there are no other languages related to Korean so that we can compare to and find out the roots of it. What?, you might say. Korean is grammatically really similar to Japanese and has huge amounts of Chinese loanwords, so how can it possibly be an isolate? Well, if you have at least glanced at the Wikipedia article above, it says that an isolate has to have no *genetic* relationships with any other language. Korean has none. Korean might have given or received tons of influence from other languages, but it never had a sibling (Or there might have been, but all of them must have died out or become assimilated into standard Korean). But Korean does have traces we can find in history.

If you know a bit about Korean history, you should know about the [Three Kingdoms period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea). Basically, three kingdoms: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla ruled the Korean peninsula from 1st century B.C. to 7th centry A.D. Then Silla won a big war and unified the three kingdoms in 669 A.D., then it went on being the ruler of the peninsula until 935 A.D., when it was conquered by Goryeo(Guess where 'Korea' came from), which was a descendant of the fallen Goguryeo Kingdom.

What we should know about this story is that the capital of Silla was Geumseong, which was in present-day [Gyeongju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongju), which is in the southeastern part of the Korean peninsula. Then the kingdom that overtook it, Goryeo, set its capital in Gaeseong(Kaesong), which is in the southernmost part of present-day North Korea. Then the Joseon Dynasty which overtook Goryeo centuries later set its capital in Seoul, which is not far from Gaeseong. So the most abrupt change must be in the Geumseong -> Gaeseong(Silla -> Goryeo) transition. That is where we set the marker as the beginning of Middle Korean. See, the shift of standard dialect as from the southern dialect to the central dialect was so impactful on the language development, that linguists set the beginning of a new era for the language right there. So Middle Korean: it's the historical version of the Korean Language in the period of 10th century A.D. to the 16th century A.D.

A lot of people think that the Korean language wasn't written down, or it didn't even exist(!) before the invention of Hangul(which was in the 15th century). This isn't true. There existed several ways of writing Korean Langauge into text even before the invention of Hangul, it was just that.. they weren't complete writing systems which could fully express the language. But we can guess the grammar and the pronunication of the language, even with the incomplete writing systems. Then Hangul came by, in the middle of the Middle Korean period, and boom--suddenly tons of resources to do research. But even with Hangul, it's hard the guess the exact pronunciation of the language, because things like sound changes and vowel shifts happen, and writing doesn't normally reflect that.

### Middle Korean Orthography

Middle Korean, after the 15th century, was mainly written in Hangul script, which is a feature alphabet that captures the sounds of words, rather than the meanings like in Chinese. It is said that King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty made the whole writing system all by himself. The original book that announced the script, [Hunminjeongeum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunminjeongeum), lists few more letters than those we use today. Let's look at those obsolete characters and see how the orthography differs from Modern Korean.
