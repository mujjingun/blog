title: How was Korean written before the advent of Hangul?
---

As you all might know, *Hangul* or the Korean alphabet was a great invention by King Sejong, announced in 1446 by the book Hunminjeongeum--*Correct sounds for the instruction of the people*. It was an alphabet designed for the Korean people, for the Korean Language. But there's a common misconception that the Korean language was not written down, or not even spoken before 1446. In fact, ways to write Korean did exist, by incorporating Chinese characters. But Chinese characters have a problem: it was designed for the Chinese Language, for the Chinese people. In other words, Chinese characters is not an alphabet, it is an ideographic script, and each character has both a *sound* and a *meaning*. How the heck do you express Korean using Chinese characters? It's not like expressing English with Latin letters. That's why there's no one way to do it, instead several ways existed, differing by usage and period. So let's take a look at them.

## 1. Translated into Classical Chinese

This was the most common way, if it's even considered a way to write Korean. Classical Chinese(한문 in Korean, 文言文 in Chinese) was like the Latin of East Asia. Every diplomatic documents were written in it, and it was the practical *and* proper way to write *anything*, even after the advent of Hangul. 

Classical Chinese looks like this:
  > 日本國王源義持, 遣使獻象。 象, 我國未嘗有也。 命司僕養之, 日費豆四五斗。
  > *The Japanese King offered elephants, which is nonexistent in Korea. They were ordered to be kept in *Saboksi*.*

There's also a [Classical Chinese Wikipedia](https://zh-classical.wikipedia.org), check it out if you're interested.

 So it was natural to translate anything a person had said into Classical Chinese if you wanted to record it somehow. But this is where the misconception has risen. The history books of Korea were written in Classical Chinese, which contains quotes of Korean people's sayings, which is also written in Classical Chinese. This doesn't mean that Koreans spoke Classical Chinese. That doesn't even make any sense. Nobody "speaks" Classical Chinese, not even the Chinese. It's strictly a literary language. The reading sounds of Classical Chinese varies significantly by language and Chinese "dialects", which are descendants of Classical Chinese. Just like how French and Italian are both descendants of vulgar Latin, Cantonese and Mandarin are both descendants of Classical Chinese. And like how [English has its own way of reading latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_English_pronunciation_of_Latin), Korean has its own way of reading Classical Chinese. More on [Sino-xenic pronunciations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Xenic_pronunciations).

But translations have limits on fully expressing the language. You can't translate over the sounds, the nuances, the rhythm, and the rhymes. That's why several other methods exist.

## 2. Chaja

*Chaja*(借字, lit. *borrowing characters*) is bascially [transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration). This is the basis for all other methods below. How do you transliterate to Chinese characters? You use the *sound* value of the characters that approximates the original pronunciation. This is called *eumcha*(音借). An example: 佛蘭西(Korean 불란서, Mandarin Fǎlánxī) has nothing to do with Buddha or orchids, what the first two characters' *meaning*s suggest. Instead, it's a transliteration of the country name "France". 

On the contrary, you could use the *meaning* of the characters for transliteration. This is called *huncha*(訓借). How does this work? Well, when Koreans memorize Hanja, you memorize the *meaning* and the *sound* in parallel. For instance, 玄 is memorized as "검을 현". The first part (검을, "to be black") is the *meaning*, and the second part "현" is the *sound*, which has been borrowed from the Chinese pronunciation of that charcter. *Huncha* is using the sound of the *meaning* part to transliterate. Thing to note is that this first "meaning" part is usually a native Korean word, therefore it gives access to a wider range of sounds.

For example, there is a river called 탄천(炭川) in Korea that runs across Gangnam, Songpa, and Bundang. When you're walking along the river, reading the street signs, you'll notice that many place names around that area are similar, like a town named 수내동, a bridge named 숯내교, a park named 숯내공원, etc. How can you explain this? Well, the river's name was not originally 炭川. That's reasonable, if you think about it. It's a Korean place name, why would it be in Chinese Characters in the first place? 炭 in Korean is "숯 탄", 川 is "내 천". That's right, the river's name was originally "숯내". Probably the government official who first recorded the river's name put it in *huncha*. And as time went on, people forgot that the name was *huncha*, and began to read the characters by their *sound*. In fact, almost every single place name in Korea is a translation or a transliteration, either by *huncha* or *eumcha*, but either way, nowadays they're all read by *sound*.

## 3. Idu

Classical Chinese(or Chinese in general) has no case markers, small "words" that indicate the grammatical function of the marked word, like Korean '이/가'(the subject marker). Also Chinese is an SVO(Subject-Verb-Object) language, as opposed to Korean SOV(Subject-Object-Verb). This makes it difficult for Korean to write and understand Classical Chinese. So what if we reordered the Classical Chinese word order to SOV and added markers and verb endings to it? That's what they did.

Wait, how do you express markers if Classical Chinese didn't have any? You used the *chaja* method for that. For instance, 乙(새 **을**) was used for the object marker 을/를, and 爲遣(**할** 위, 보낼 **고**) was used for the verb ending 하고. 

  >  蠶**段**陽物**是乎等用良**水氣**乙**厭却桑葉**叱分**喫破**爲遣**飲水**不冬**

An example of an *idu* sentence from 1415. The bold letters are the markers(토). This is read as:
  >  잠**딴** 양물**이온들쓰아** 수기**를** 염각, 상엽**뿐** 끽파**하고** 음수**안들**

In Modern Korean, this is:
  >  누에는 양물으로서 물기를 싫어해 뽕잎만 먹고 물은 아니 마신다. --*Silkworms like dryness; they avoid moistness, and they only eat mulberry leaves, and does not drink water.*

However, there are several problems with this method *idu*. First, you can't know for sure if each character is read with their meaning or sound, hence confusion arises. And second, it's still 95% Chinese, however deformed it is. In other words, it couldn't fully express the Korean language.

## 4. Gugyeol

*Gugyeol*(口訣) is actually a *huncha* of the word "입겿", which is another word for "토", *markers and verb endings*. It's similar to how *idu* works, but it differs in some ways:

1. It retains the word order of Chinese, subject-verb-object.
2. The markers and verb ending parts are not written with traditional Chinese charcters, instead the strokes are drastically reduced. Sometimes two or more characters are merged.
3. It's mainly used to make easy *reading* classical Classical Chinese texts, not writing them.

These are the characters used in Gugyeol:

Doesn't this look familiar? It's very similar to Katakana in Japanese. In fact, this was also pretty much how Japanese writing came to be. Japan had a lot of influence from Korea during the Three Kingdoms period, which is when this form of writing developed in Korea. It's likely that Japanese writing was influenced by Gugyeol.

## 5. Hyangchal

Lastly, *hyangchal*(鄕札, lit. writing of the homeland) was the only system that could fully express the Korean language, in the sense that it doesn't have to incorporate any Chinese vocabulary in the text. It uses the *chaja* method exclusively, every character is a transliteration. *Hyangchal* was used mainly for recording Korean folk songs and poetry. Poetry recorded in *hyangchal* was called *hyangga*(鄕歌, lit. songs of the homeland). The most famous one is the 서동요. It goes like this:

> 善化公主**主隱**

> **他密**只**嫁良置古**

> **薯**童房**乙**

> **夜矣**夘乙**抱遣去如**

The bold parts are read by *meaning*, and the rest is read by *sound*. In Hangul, this would be:

> 선화공쥬니ᄆᆞᆫ

> ᄂᆞᆷ그ᅀᅳ지얼어두고

> 맛둥바ᄋᆞᆯ

> 바ᄆᆡ몰안고가다

As you can see, there's no Chinese vocabulary in the text except 公主(princess). But also this makes reading extremely difficult, since there is no hint whatsoever if a character is read in sound or meaning. Also if it's read in meaning, we can't know for sure what word was used, and how. This makes several different interpretations possible for a single piece.

This is it. I hope you all have bigger understanding about how Korean worked in the past. Thanks for reading my first post!
