title: History of Hangul, Part 1 Middle Korean
draft: true
---

Hi, starting off from the [last post](https://mujjingun.github.io/blog/How-was-Korean-written/) where I explained how Koreans wrote their language before Hangul, today's post is about how Hangul was like right after its birth.

### History of the Korean Language (and Korea)

Korean has existed since, well, forever. Precisely, we don't know for sure how long the language has existed, or where it came from. That's because Korean is a [language isolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate). In other words, there are no other languages related to Korean so that we can compare to and find out the roots of it. *What?*, you might say. *Korean is grammatically really similar to Japanese and has huge amounts of Chinese loanwords, so how can it possibly be an isolate?* Well, if you have at least glanced at the Wikipedia article above, it says that an isolate has to have no *genetic* relationships with any other language. Korean has none. Korean might have given or received tons of influence from other languages, but it never had a sibling (Or there might have been, but all of them must have died out or become assimilated into standard Korean). But Korean does have traces we can find in history.

If you know a bit about Korean history, you should know about the [Three Kingdoms period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea). Basically, three kingdoms: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla ruled the Korean peninsula from the 1st century B.C. to the 7th centry A.D. Then Silla won a big war and unified the three kingdoms in 669 A.D., then it went on being the ruler of the peninsula until 935 A.D., when it was conquered by Goryeo(Guess where 'Korea' came from), which was a descendant of the fallen Goguryeo Kingdom.

What we should note about this story is that the capital of Silla was Geumseong, which was in present-day [Gyeongju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongju), which is in the southeastern part of the Korean peninsula. Then the kingdom that overtook it, Goryeo, set its capital in Gaeseong(Kaesong), which is in the southernmost part of present-day North Korea. And the Joseon Dynasty which overtook Goryeo centuries later set its capital in Seoul, which is not far from Gaeseong. So the most abrupt change must be in the Geumseong -> Gaeseong transition. That is where we set the marker as the beginning of Middle Korean. See, the shift of standard dialect as from the southern dialect to the central dialect was so impactful on the language development, that linguists set the beginning of a new era for the language right there. So Middle Korean: it's the historical "version" of the Korean Language in the period of 10th century A.D. to the 16th century A.D.

It was all dark ages for researchers of the Korean Language, then Hangul came by in the middle of the Middle Korean period, and boom--suddenly tons of resources to do research.

### Middle Korean Orthography

Middle Korean, after the 15th century, was mainly written in Hangul script, which is a feature alphabet that captures the sounds of words, rather than the meanings like in Chinese. It is said that King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty made the whole writing system all by himself. The original book that announced the script, [Hunminjeongeum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunminjeongeum) actually exists by two versions.

1. 훈민정음 언해본(訓民正音諺解本). This book, that starts with 나랏말ᄊᆞ미, is the most well-known one. It's written line-by-line like this: Classical Chinese with Hangul *to*(토) first, Hangul translation next, and then Korean explanation of the Classical Chinese text. The preface explains King Sejong's intention of creating such a script, and the main content explains letters with their corresponding sound.

2. 훈민정음 해례본(訓民正音解例本) is also called 훈민정음 원본 -- "The original book of Hunminjeongeum". The existence of it has been long known, but it has only been discovered in the 1940's. This book explains the history, philosophy and the reasoning behind each character of Hangul, one by one, in Classical Chinese.

Let's look at the first book's famous preface.

> 國<sub>귁〮</sub>之<sub>징</sub>語<sub>엉〯</sub>音<sub>ᅙᅳᆷ</sub>이

This is the first line, in Classical Chinese.
