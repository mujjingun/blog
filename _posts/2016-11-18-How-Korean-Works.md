title: How Korean Writing Works(and have worked)
---

I've seen a lot of questions regarding the [orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography) of the Korean Language, both on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/) and on [Korean SE](http://korean.stackexchange.com/). Specifically, when to use the 'null ㅇ' or not, in words like 곳에, 움직이다, 같이, and 학원. At first glance, the null ㅇ's look totally redundant, since they are pronounced the same as [고세], [움지기다], [가치], and [하권]. So what's the point of putting them in? I mean, it only makes spelling more complicated.

Well, that's not exactly true. The ㅇ's serve more purpose than just complicating the writing system.
